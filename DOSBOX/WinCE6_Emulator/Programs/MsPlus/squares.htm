<A NAME="AboutSquares"></A><B>About Squares</B>
<br>
Squares is a game of strategy. The idea is to connect the dots in such
a way that you -- not your opponent --  can draw the final line that
completes a square. For each square you complete, you get one point.
Since your opponent follows the same rules, both of you endeavor
(most of the time) to stop the other from completing a square.
<p>
The rules are simple:
<ul>
<li>You can connect dots using only horizontal and vertical lines. Diagonal lines are not allowed.
<li>When you complete a square, you are allowed to make another move.
</ul>
<p>
<B>Tips</B>
<ul>
<li>Unless it fits with a well-thought-out strategy, don't make the
third edge of a square, because your opponent can then complete the
square and make a point.
<li>It is sometimes beneficial to give up some squares early in the
game. But be careful!
</ul>

<a name="RandomLines"></a><B>Starting a Game with Random Lines</B>
<br>
If you and your opponent have played Squares enough to have developed a
strategy, starting a game with random lines is a good way to add some
challenges to your game. You can add random lines to a new game or to
a game in progress.
<ul>
<li>Select <B>File</B> > <B>Add Random Lines</B>.
The lines are scattered throughout the game board.
</ul>
