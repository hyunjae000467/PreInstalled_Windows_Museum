  Clanger Theremin</b></font><font face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
  &copy;2004 SiliconMachines Software<br>
  A FreeWare Theremin for your PocketPC<br>
  <br>
  Using this theremin is simplicity itself. Simply move your stylus/finger around 
  on the multicoloured pad with the picture of the clanger on it. Moving horizontally 
  will cause the frequency to change. Moving vertically will cause the amplitude 
  (volume) to change. With skill and practice there's no reason why you can't 
  become a virtuoso at this simple instrument, especially with the help of the 
  QUANTIZE switch (see below).<br>
  <br>
  There are various user adjusted controls:<br>
  <br>
  <b><font size="4">DELAYTIME ms</font></b><br>
  This specifies the length of the digital delay line in milliseconds.<br>
  <b><font size="4"><br>
  DELAYFBK %</font></b><br>
  This specifies the percentage of the delay line that is fed back. Well it's 
  not actually a percentage as it ranges from 0...128, but I'm sure you get the 
  jist ;)<br>
  <br>
  <b><font size="4">CLR</font></b><br>
  Pressing this will clear out the delay line (silence it).<br>
  <br>
  <b><font size="4">FEED</font></b> <br>
  When this is set ON, the theremins output is routed into the digital delay line.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b>FREQUENCY QUANTIZE</b></font><br>
  This control has a little icon underneath it, the icon looks like a musical 
  note on a stave. When this switch is in the ON position, the theremin frequency 
  is always moved to the nearest real musical note.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b>LOGO ON/OFF</b></font><br>
  This control has a little icon underneath it, the icon looks like a tiny Clanger.This 
  button designates whether or not the logo graphic, the Clanger, is shown on 
  the theremin pad.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b>LOWFREQ x 10HZ</b></font><br>
  This specifies the frequency that will sound when the stylus is at the leftmost 
  position of the theremin pad. As the label suggests the reading of this dial 
  must be multiplied by ten in order to read it as Hz.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b>HIGHFREQ x 10HZ</b></font><br>
  This specifies the frequency that will sound when the stylus is at the rightmost 
  position of the theremin pad. As the label suggests the reading of this dial 
  must be multiplied by ten in order to read it as Hz.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b>RESPONSE<br>
  </b></font>This specifies the speed with which the theremins oscillator responds 
  to the user changing the frequency. A lower value will cause frequency slides 
  to be much slower and more noticable.<br>
  </font><font face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
  <b><font size="4">Adjusting the controls</font></b><br>
  You can adjust the various knobs and dials in three ways:<br>
  <br>
  [1]<br>
  Tap the blue LED number and then drag horizontally or vertically.<br>
  <br>
  [2]<br>
  Tap a purple knob and the drag horizontally or vertically.<br>
  <br>
  [3]<br>
  Tap the grey inc/dec buttons for precise adjustments.<br>
