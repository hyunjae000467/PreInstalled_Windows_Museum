This menu option displays a dialog box asking you 4 things: (1) the text that you want to search for, (2) whether to look for it in the formulas (what was typed into the cells) or in the values (what is displayed in the cells), (3) whether the search is to be case-sensitive (whether you want upper and lower case letters to be treated as different), and (4) whether to find cells that are equal to the text that you typed or just contain the text that you typed. Entering these and pressing OK will move the cursor to the first cell after the current cursor position that matches your request.
