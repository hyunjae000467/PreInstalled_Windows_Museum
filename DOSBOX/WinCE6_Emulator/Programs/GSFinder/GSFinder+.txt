Small User Guide for GSFinder+ on HandheldPCs/Palm-sizePCs:

GSFinder+ is a great freeware File Manager and a perfect replacement for the
default Windows CE/PocketPC File Explorer.
GSFinder was first created by Y. Nagamidori as an open source application;
GSFinder+ is an advanced version of GSFinder made by M.Toda
(E-Mail:todamitsu@hotmail.com) introducing some new features like ZIP archives
management, Drag-and-Drop , network options, file search and "automatic refresh".

The main features of GSFinder+ for HandheldPCs are:

-1) Small size, quick

-2) Familiar interface using intuitive context menus
  (for example: copy or move any file to any folder, create a shortcut anywhere);
  context menus may be invoked either by "Alt+Tap" or by
  "Tap and Hold" (just like PocketPCs); optional folder tree;
  familiar 'look and feel';

-3) Drag and Drop:
  Drag-and-Drop is activated by default. To facilitate some operations,
  you may disable "Drag-and-Drop" if you uncheck the "Drag and Drop" Menu item
  (Edit menu).
  * default behavior: moves the file to the destination folder
  * Ctrl Key + 'Drag and Drop' : makes a copy of the file to the new folder
  * Shift Key + 'Drag and Drop' : opens a popup menu with different options
    (copy, move or shortcut creation)

-4) ZIP/LHA Archives Management:
  you can create new ZIP/LHA archives from the 'File' menu (or context menu) and
  extract them.
  IMPORTANT: to use the compression features, it is necessary to install
  an additional Dll (unzip.dll/unlha.dll) available from here:
  http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA023546/soft/unXXXce.html.

  Just place UNZIP.DLL/UNLHA.DLL in the same folder as GSFinder.exe
  (or in the'Windows'folder of your device).
  
  WARNING: after the installation of Unzip.dll/UnLHA.dll,
  enable the ZIP/LHA compression in the Options Dialog (Compression tab)
  and soft-reset your device before trying
  to compress a file with GSFinder+.
  According to the compression settings (see options dialog) you can either
  extract archives automatically, or from the 'File' menu or context menu
  (Open / Extract).
  Files and folders can be compressed either from the 'File' menu or from
  the context menu (Send to: ZIP/LHA Archive).

-5) Open any file with different applications
  (you may override the default file associations):

 - FIRST METHOD: This method is exactly the same as the "open with..." feature
   found in desktop PCs.
   From the 'File' Menu (or the context menu), tap Open/Choose Program :
   A dialog with a choice of registered applications appears. You may select
   any of them to open the selected file. You can also use the 'Browse' button
   to select any other executable on your device.
   If you select the checkbox ("always use this program to open these files"),
   the default file association will be changed.

 - SECOND METHOD: using the popup menu of any file or the 'File' Menu
   (File/Send To), you can open any file with your preferred applications.
   To enable this feature, you must place shortcuts of your preferred
   applications in a specific folder (default : \Windows\Sendto ; see the
   "Shell Options" dialog).
   You need to close and restart GSFinder+ after any new shortcut.
   After this, you can open any application with the applications listed
   in the 'Send To' submenu (File Menu or Context Menu).

-6) 'Go' Menu, containing a 'Favorites' Submenu, to quickly access your
   favorite files, applications, internet favorites, etc.
   This menu can point to the regular 'Internet Explorer Favorites' or to any
   other specific folder
   (you may choose this folder, using the 'Options' dialog, ' System Path' tab):
   any shortcut placed in this folder will appear in the 'Favorites' menu
   of GSFinder+. You can automatically add any file to your favorites using
   the 'add' menu option.
   'Organize' will open your 'favorites' folder in GSFinder+
   (warning: if you manually alter the contents of your 'Favorites' Folder,
   the changes won't appear until you use the 'Refresh' option of GSFinder+)

  - Useful Locations: 
  * this feature allows a quick access to some system paths like'Start Menu',
    'Desktop', etc. Depending on the language of your OS, you can precise
    the correct path of different system folders:
    just use the 'Option' dialog, 'System Path' tab.
  * User-determined locations: this feature allows "quick paths" to your
    preferred folders:
    a tap on 'User Path' will bring a dialog to add your current location
    in this menu, or delete or edit your shortcuts.

-7) Map 'Network'folders:
  If you are on a local network (via wifi or any other network card),
  GSFinder+ gives you the possibility to automatically setup a 'Network' Folder
  to access your shares (soft-reset needed). When the 'Network' Folder has been
  enabled, you can map a network connection from the 'View\Tools\Network Connect'
  menu.
  The 'remote path' should be something like: \\MyPC\shareddocs and the local
  name of the network Folder can be any name.

-8) File Search:
  this feature has been dramatically improved in the 1.0 version of GSFinder+.
  File Searches are now very quick.

-9) File Associations:
  you may choose and change file associations from the "File Types" option.

-10) Automatic refresh feature (Sigmarion 3 /CE.Net only):
  generally, it is no longer necessary to use the Refresh button.
  GSFinder+ automaticaly detects new files and folders created or copied to
  your device.

-11) 5 Different "View styles".
  "Detailed View" means that only the icon of a file can be selected;
  "Detailed View(Line Select)" means that the full line of a given file can be
  a selected.

* Settings for "Network Connect", 
  Remote Path: [\\<machine name>\<share folder name>]
  Local Name: [<any name>]. 
  Remote folders will be displayed under the [Network] tree.
