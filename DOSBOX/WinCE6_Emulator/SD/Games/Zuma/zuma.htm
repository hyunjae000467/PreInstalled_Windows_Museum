<H2>Zuma</H2>

<H3>How to Play</H3>
<P>The goal in Zuma is to fire balls from the rotating stone frog in the centre to make groups of 3 or more balls of the same colour.  Doing so removes those balls from the line. The ultimate goal of each level is to remove all the balls before they reach the skull pit.</P>

<P>You can fire the ball currently in the frog's mouth by tapping anywhere on the screen.  This will fire the ball at the place you tapped.  You can also drag the stylus on the screen to aim the frog, and the ball will fire when you lift the stylus.</P>

<P>You can see the colour of the next ball that you will get by looking at the top of the frogs head.  You may also switch the ball currently in the frog's mouth with this one by tapping on the frog's head.</P>

<P>Removing balls from the middle of a moving line will stop the ones in front of that point from moving for a while, while the balls behind them catch up. If the ball colours on separated ends of a chain match, then the front set of balls will roll backwards to meet the others.  This can also create matches (called combo matches).</P>

<P>As you make matches, the yellow progress bar at the top will fill - making matches with more balls, or creating combos, will fill this bar faster!  Once this bar is full, no new balls will be generated, so all you need to do is clear the remaining balls from the level before they fall into the pit.</P>

<H3>Hints and Tips</H3>
<P>Make combos!  Balls of the same colour will attract each other, so if there is a gap with balls of the same colour at each end, the forward set of balls will roll backwards to meet up.  This can help pull balls away from the skull pit, but can also result in a combo.  You get lots of extra points for a combo match, and even more if you get multiple combo matches!</P>

<P>Coins occasionally appear in the corners of the level - fire a ball at it to pick it up.  Coins give a bonus to your score, and also help you greatly towards reaching Zuma!</P>

</P>Some balls will display an icon indicating that they "hold" special ability.  To get that ability, you need to remove that ball by matching it in the normal way.</P>

<P>Special ball abilities include: </P>
<UL>
<LI>Slow down : Slows the balls progression down for a short period of time.</LI>
<LI>Explosive : When matched, this ball will explode, removing balls from all around it!</LI>
<LI>Reverse : Causes all the balls to run backwards for a few seconds.  Useful if you are in a fix!</LI>
<LI>Accuracy : When you gain this special ability, a blue indicator will appear at the frog's mouth and extend outwards, indicating the path the ball will take when fired.  Use this to help aim more accurately</LI>
