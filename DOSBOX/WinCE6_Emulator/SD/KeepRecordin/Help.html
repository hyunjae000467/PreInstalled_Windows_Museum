<h1>Keep Recordin' 1.0</h1>
<p>Keep Recordin' is a very simple, intuitive and lightweight mobile audio recorder. It is a nice replacement for the standard Windows Mobile audio recorder, because it allows to choose a directory in which recorded audio files will be stored. Keep Recordin' also suppresses ambient noises and stores audio files in chronological order.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Keep Recordin' is extremely easy to use. Launch the application, press left menu button 'Record' and the recording will immediately start. When you wish, press the same button again (now it is called 'Stop') to stop the recording. That's it!</p>
<p>Optionally, you can define the destination directory, where all recordings will be saved. Keep Recordin' will remember the directory of your choice and will use in the future by default. Initially the default destination directory is the application directory.</p>
