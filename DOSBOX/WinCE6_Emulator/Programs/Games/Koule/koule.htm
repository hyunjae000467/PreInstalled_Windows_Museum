&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the game is to collect as many points as
possible. You get points any time you link 5 or more pieces of the same colour
in a line. To do this, you can move the pieces around the 9x9 square board. A
piece to move cannot jump, so you can move it to an empty square only in case
there is an open way to get there. You can move from square to square only
horizontally or vertically, not diagonally, as illustrated below:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game starts with 5 pieces arranged randomly on the board.
After every move the computer adds 3 more pieces on empty squares. Within one
move you can move one piece over any number of adjanced squares. Click a piece
to move it. The selected piece is emphasized. In case you changed your mind,
click any other piece. To complete a move, click the target square. A sound of a
beep indicates the intended move is invalid.</FONT></P>
