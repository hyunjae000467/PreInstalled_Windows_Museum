<H1 id=tochome0>PocketGPS-Map</H1><BR>(c) 2007 Andrej Krutak<BR>Distributed 
under GPLv2 or newer<BR>Program is using libjpeg, libz and libpng code.<BR>This 
is my "thank you!" to their authors...<BR><BR>
<H2 id=tochome1>USAGE</H2>
<H3 id=tochome2>Basics</H3>The program can be run on win32 (WindowsXP tested) 
and PocketPC platform (tested on 2003 emulator and a WM5.0 HTC Wizard device). 
Of course, you have to use different binaries :-) The win32 version has exactly 
the same capabilities and almost the same look as the pocketpc one (except that 
you can't use too big images on PPC - unless you use tiled ones.. see below). 
The main reason for it's existence is to test maps - it's simpler to prepare and 
test a map on desktop than on a PDA/smartphone.<BR><BR>After you start the 
program, the first thing you may want to do is select source of GPS "signal" - 
using the <STRONG>Config-Set GPS Device</STRONG> menu item. In current version, 
it can be either serial (COM) port or a file with stored "signal stream" (raw 
NMEA protocol data).<BR><BR>Now you can switch to the GPS Info view 
(<STRONG>Config-Show GPS info</STRONG>) to see informations (like your position, 
satellite position info) from the GPS signal source.<BR><BR>Maybe you want to 
use the program for navigating in maps. You can choose the atlas containing maps 
by <STRONG>Config-Load atlas</STRONG>. There you have to input path to the the 
atlas (use \ character to separate directories, and put a \ also on the end of 
path). After that, program automagically searches available maps and starts 
using them. Oh yes - you can switch to Map view by using <STRONG>Config-Show 
Map)</STRONG><BR><BR>
<H3 id=tochome3>Advanced usage</H3>You may want to navigate to certain points in 
the map. For that you can use <STRONG>Map-Waypoints</STRONG> menu item. There 
you can add new waypoints and select the one to which you will navigate in map. 
If you press the button "Clear selection", no waypoint will be selected. After 
you press OK, the program will start the navigation to selected waypoints (if 
any).<BR><EM>Note</EM>: When inputting the coordinates, the North and East 
values are positive numbers (+14.2231, 55.904), West and South are negative 
(-13.214). You can use the provided coordinate-helper (by pressing button ° in 
the right of longitude/latitude field) - it will help you with conversion of 
coordinates to required format.<BR><BR>By using <STRONG>zoom in/out</STRONG>, 
you can select more or less precise map, if there is any in atlas, for your 
current location. If <STRONG>follow position</STRONG> is checked (the checking 
may not work on pocketpc 2003, but the function still works ;-), the your 
position will be always in the center of view. <STRONG>Auto switch</STRONG> 
ensures automatical selection of map (if there is any apropriate), if you go 
outside the current one. <STRONG>Always best zoom</STRONG> item makes the 
program always choose the map with best zoom. If it isn't checked/used, map 
won't be changed until you go outside of it. You can choose to view any map from 
the atlas by <STRONG>Choose map</STRONG> item (note that all 3 previous 
functions are automatically disabled in this case... you can reenable them, but 
other than selected map may be open afterwards).<BR><BR>
<H3 id=tochome4>GPS Info screen</H3>This screen contains info about the data 
from GPS device/data source.<BR><BR>First line contains count of NMEA messages 
received from the source and the current time of the source.<BR><BR>The second 
row contains list of used satellites and strengths of their signals.<BR><BR>Next 
line contains mode of GPS (whether there is a fix, if it is 2D or 3D and what is 
the accuracy).<BR>Then there is number of satellites in view used for position 
calculation.<BR><BR>Next lines specify current position (Latitude, Longitude, 
Altitude)...<BR><BR>The compass on the right side of display shows where the 
north is (assuming that you are moving with the pda in front of you) and where 
are the satellites on the sky (blue ones are the ones used in 
calculations).<BR><BR>
<H3 id=tochome5>Map screen</H3>The main part of screen is the map :-) If a big 
green circle is visible, that is your position. The cyan arrow shows direction 
of your movement and the white (empty inside) one shows direction to the 
waypoint (if any selected).<BR><BR>Orange circle, if shown, is the waypoint 
position.<BR><BR>On the bottom of screen you can see:<BR>In 1st column the 
current position.<BR>In 2nd column altitude and speed.<BR>In 3rd column distance 
to the waypoint and direction where in which you should move if you want to get 
to the waypoint (assumes you are moving with the PDA in front of you).<BR><BR>
<H2 id=tochome6>CREATING OWN MAPS/ATLASES</H2>
<H3 id=tochome7>Atlas</H3>Atlas is just a directory containing other directories 
:-) Each directory contained has to contain one map.<BR>The structure of atlas 
may look like this:<BR>
<STYLE type=text/css>.text .imp {
	FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: red
}
</STYLE>
<PRE class=text>atlas\
    map1\
        map1.map
        map1.png
    map123\
        map123.map
        set\
            map123_0_0.png
            map123_100_0.png
&nbsp;</PRE><BR>Additionaly, you can use TAR files (tarballs) to 'pack' maps 
into one file (might be useful if you have many maps which contain many files - 
the space on storage card is better used this way). Each tar file must have the 
same structure as a map directory, e.g.:<BR>
<STYLE type=text/css>.text .imp {
	FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: red
}
</STYLE>
<PRE class=text>atlas\
    map1.tar\
         map1.map
         set\
             map1_0_0.png
             ...
&nbsp;</PRE><BR>
<H3 id=tochome8>Map</H3>Each map is defined by a file with a name in form 
MAPNAME.map, where MAPNAME is the name of map directory. Currently PocketGPS-Map 
support (hopefully) OziExplorer (or TrekBuddy) map format and it's own simple 
format (it's preferred for simple creating :-)).<BR><BR><STRONG>OziExplorer 
format</STRONG><BR>...TODO (you may find the description 
elsewhere)<BR><BR><STRONG>Own simple format</STRONG><BR>The .map file begins 
with<BR>Simple Calibration v1<BR>string.<BR>Then any number of lines may follow. 
Each one has to begin with a tag (1 word) meaning, what does the line specify. 
Here are currenly recognized tags:<BR><EM>SIZE x y</EM> - specifies total size 
of image<BR><EM>DATUM datum_name</EM> - specifies datum of coordinates of 
calibration points (see below)<BR><EM>CAL lon lat x y</EM> - specifies a 
calibration point. Meaning: specifies that point [x,y] on the map is [lon,lat] 
in real world.<BR><EM>IMG path</EM> - specifies, which image should be loaded 
for this map. If nothing specified, images from <EM>set</EM> or 
<EM>pictures</EM> subdirectory will be used<BR><EM>PART x y</EM> - specifies 
size of a image tile (see next section)<BR><BR>
<H3 id=tochome9>Map calibration</H3>If you want to use the map with GPS, you 
have to specify calibration points. A calibration point specifies, which point 
in map coresponds to which point in the real world (latitude/longitude). The 
more points are specified, the more accurate the position in the map can be 
calculated. However, at least 2 points have to be specified (the nearer to top 
left and bootom right corners, the better).<BR><BR>There are many different so 
called <EM>datums</EM> that can be used to specify world-coordinates (mostly 
these are country/region-specific). GPS devices mostly use WGS-84 datum, and so 
do e.g. Google maps. Anyway, you might get a map that is calibrated using other 
datum. In this case, you can find the datums supported by pocketgps-map in 
<EM>datums.csv</EM> file in it's directory. Choose the one nearest to original 
map datum (most probably you will find exactly the one you are searching for... 
otherwise you can add the datum to the datum.csv file by yourself - an you can 
also send the new datum to the author) and specify it by DATUM tag in 
calibration file. If you don't know how to work with datums, you might some 
informations on google.<BR><BR>
<H3 id=tochome10>Image files</H3>When you create a map, you obviously have to 
give some bitmap to the program :-) It currently supports BMP, PNG and JPG 
formats. If you use just one image, specify it in configuration file.<BR><BR>If 
you want to used tiled image (really good for PDAs and other devices with 
limited memory), you have to slice the images to parts and put them in 
<EM>set</EM> or <EM>pictures</EM> subdirectory (in any of the 3 mentioned 
formats).<BR><BR>If you are using OziExplorer map definition format, you have to 
name images in format MAPNAME_x_y.EXT, where x and y is the position of top left 
corner of tile in the whole image.<BR><BR>You can use the same convention in 
simple format. However you can also index the images (like MAPNAME_0_0.EXT, 
MAPNAME_0_1.EXT etc.), but in this case you have to manually specify tile size 
by using the PART tagged line.<BR><BR>
<H2 id=tochome11>Explanation of tiled images</H2>The tiled image names can be in 
two formats...<BR><BR>
<H3 id=tochome12>* First</H3>- more intuitive - is that you split the big image 
into small pieces. Let's say the image has dimensions 3005x2005 and you want to 
split it into pieces of size 100x50. In this case, images will be named 
like<BR>prefix_0_0.jpg<BR>prefix_0_50.jpg<BR>prefix_0_100.jpg<BR>...<BR>prefix_100_0.jpg<BR>...<BR>prefix_3000_2000.jpg<BR><BR>(The 
pieces on the right and bottom don't have to be of full size - they can be 
smaller (in a logical way :-))).<BR><BR>All these files have to be placed inside 
of 'set' subdirectory of map. The name of map configuration file is then 
'prefix.map' and the map directory has to be named 'prefix'. The corresponding 
map could look like the following then:<BR><BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>Simple 
Calibration v1<BR>SIZE 3005 2005<BR>CAL 1 2 0 0<BR>CAL 3 4 3005 
2005<BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR><BR><BR>
<H3 id=tochome13>* Second</H3>is similar to the first - the only difference is 
the naming of files and a little addition to configuration file. Some programs 
can't name the tiles of original images the way mentioned, they'd do it 
like:<BR>prefix_0_0.jpg<BR>prefix_0_1.jpg<BR>prefix_0_2.jpg<BR>...<BR>prefix_1_0.jpg<BR>...<BR>prefix_30_40.jpg 
(maybe the numbers here are wrong, I'm not in the mood to check :-))<BR><BR>In 
this case you just have to add a line<BR><BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>PART 
100 50<BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR><BR>to the config file (in addition to 
already mentioned contents) to specify size of a tile (again - the tiles on the 
right and bottom can be of different sizes, of course). If you don't specify 
this, program will try to guess the size of tile by loading the prefix_0_0 file. 
This can slowdown the program startup - so you better specify this in 
configuration file, if it's possible.<BR><BR>As you can see, you only specify 
calibration points for the whole (virtual) image (the tiles are just an 
abstraction :-)).<BR><BR>I don't know what do you mean by overlappting tiled 
images - but the tiles of a single image have to face each other (i.e. tiles of 
image can be created by simply cutting the image to pieces).<BR><BR>Hopefully 
the following image will clarify the concept of tiled images another bit more 
(thanks to axel):<BR><BR><IMG title=tiled_maps.png alt=tiled_maps.png 
src="tiled_maps.jpg"><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<H2 id=tochome14>FINAL NOTES</H2>ALWAYS use lowercase filenames (esp. bitmap 
extensions - program currently recognizes only bmp, png, jpg (i.e. not bMp or 
whatever)). This may/will get better in future :-)
