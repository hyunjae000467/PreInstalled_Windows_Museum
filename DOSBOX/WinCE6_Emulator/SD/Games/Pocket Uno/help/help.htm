<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>108 cards as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>19 Blue cards</strong> - 0 to 9</li>
<li><strong>19 Green cards</strong> - 0 to 9</li>
<li><strong>19 Red cards</strong> - 0 to 9</li>
<li><strong>19 Yellow cards</strong> - 0 to 9</li>

<li><strong>8 Skip cards</strong> - 2 each in blue, green, red and yellow</li>
<li><strong>4 Wild cards</strong></li>
<li><strong>4 Wild Draw Four cards</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Object</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">To be the first player to score 500 points. Points are scored by getting rid of all the cards in your hand before your opponent(s). You score points for cards left in your opponents&rsquo; hands.</p>
<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>
<p>Every player picks a card. The person who picks the highest number deals. Action Cards count as zero for this part of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Once the cards are shuffled each player is dealt 7 cards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The remainder of the deck is placed face down to form a DRAW pile. The top card of the DRAW pile is turned over to begin a DISCARD pile. If an Action Card is the first one turned up from the DRAW pile, certain rules apply (See FUNCTIONS OF ACTION CARDS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The person to the left of the dealer starts play. He/she has to match the card on the DISCARD pile, either by number, color or symbol. For example, if the card is a red 7, the player must put down a red card or any color 7. Alternatively, the player can put down a Wild card (See FUNCTIONS OF ACTION CARDS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If the player doesn&rsquo;t have a card to match the one on the DISCARD pile, he/she must take a card from the DRAW pile. If the card picked up can be played, the player is free to put it down in the same turn. Otherwise, play moves on to the next person in turn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Players may choose not to play a playable card from their hand. If so, the player must draw a card from the DRAW pile. If playable, that card can be put down in the same turn, but the player may not use a card from the hand after the draw.</p>
<p><strong>Functions of the action cards</strong></p>
<p>The functions of the Action Cards, and when they may be played, are set out below.</p>
<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="100%" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<img src="draw_two.png" alt="" width="50" height="70" /></td>
<td style="text-align: justify"><strong>Draw Two Card</strong> - When this card is played, the next person to play <em>must draw 2 cards and miss his/her turn</em>. This card can only be played on matching colors and other Draw Two cards. If turned up at the beginning of play, the same rule applies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<img src="reverse.png" alt="" width="50" height="70" /></td>
<td style="text-align: justify"><strong>Reverse Card</strong> - This simply reverses direction of play. Play to changes direction to the right, and vice versa. The card may only be played on a matching color or on another Reverse card. If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the dealer goes first, then play moves to the right instead of the left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<img src="skip.png" alt="" width="50" height="70" /></td>
<td style="text-align: justify"><strong>Skip Card</strong> - The next player to play after this card has been laid loses his/her turn and is &ldquo;<em>skipped</em>&rdquo;. The card may only be played on a matching color or on another Skip card. If a Skip card is turned up at the beginning of play, the player to the left of the dealer is &ldquo;skipped&rdquo;, hence the player to the left of that player commences play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<img src="wild.png" alt="" width="50" height="70" /></td>
<td style="text-align: justify"><strong>Wild Card</strong> - The person playing this card calls for any color to continue the play, including the one currently being played, if so desired. A Wild card can be played at any time - even if the player has another playable card in the hand. If a Wild card is turned up at the beginning of play, the person to the left of the dealer determines the color, which continues play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<img src="wild_draw_four.png" alt="" width="50" height="70" /></td>
<td style="text-align: justify"><strong>Wild Draw Four Card</strong> - This is the best card to have. The person who plays it calls the color that continues play. Also, the next player has to <em>pick up 4 cards</em> from the DRAW pile and <em>miss his/her turn</em>. Unfortunately, the card can only be played when the player holding it does not have a card in his/her hand to match the color on the DISCARD pile. If the player holds matching numbers or Action Cards, however, the Wild Draw Four card may be played. If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, it is returned to the deck and another card is picked.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p><strong>Going out</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When a player has only one card left, he/she must yell &ldquo;UNO&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;one&rdquo;). Failure to do this results in having to pick up 2 cards from the DRAW pile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Once a player has no cards left, the hand is over. Points are scored (see SCORING) and play starts over again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If the last card played in a hand is a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card, the next player must draw the 2 or 4 cards respectively. These cards are counted when the points are totalled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If no player is out of cards by the time the DRAW pile is depleted, the deck is reshuffled and play continues.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The first player to get rid of his/her cards receives 0 points,&nbsp;any other player recieves total points of cards left in&nbsp;his/her hand as follows:</p>
<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>All number cards (0-9)</td>
<td>Face Value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Draw Two</td>
<td>20 Points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reverse</td>
<td>20 Points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Skip</td>
<td>20 Points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wild</td>
<td>50 Points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wild Draw Four</td>
<td>50 Points</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Winning the game</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This game is scored by keeping a running total of what each player is caught with in their hands. As a player reaches a designated amount of 500 points, that player is eliminated from the game. When only two players are left in the game, they play head to head. The player who reaches or exceeds the amount designated loses. The winner of that final hand is declared the winning player of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Two-handed play</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This is played with the following special rules:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify">Playing a Reverse card acts like a Skip. The player who plays the Reverse may immediately play another card.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The person playing a Skip card may immediately play another card.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">When one person plays a Draw Two card and the other player has drawn the 2 cards, the play is back to the first person. The same principle applies to the Wild Draw Four card. The usual UNO&reg; card game rules apply in all other instances.</li>
